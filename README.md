## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create .env and netlify.toml files in the root directory. That's where you'll add your own firebase config. For example:**

    ```sh
    FIREBASEKEY='############'
    AUTHDOMAIN='hello-world-#####.firebaseapp.com'
    DATABASEURL='https://hello-world-#####.firebaseio.com'
    MESSAGINGSENDERID='############'
    PROJECTID='hello-world-#####'
    STORAGEBUCKET=''
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies and start the development server.**

    ```sh
    # start dev server
    yarn dev

    # build for prod with bundle analyzer
    yarn build:debug
    ```
